# Cosima

## Why?

Cosima is my attempt to create the perfect programming language. It is a low level language mixed with high level concepts. I hope to achieve a balance of high performance, extensibility and coder-friendliness.

## Features

- Context oriented programming (equivalent to object-oriented, but better)
- Templates
- Ruby-ish syntax
- ...

## Example:
    main(args = :Array) = {
      "Hello, I am Cosima!".print()
    }

## What now?

I am still finalizing the syntax/grammar, etc. Come back later to see more.
